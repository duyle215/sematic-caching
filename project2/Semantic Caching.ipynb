The group originally consisted of Melanie Brown (\\\"Scary Spice\\\"), Melanie Chisholm (\\\"Sporty Spice\\\"), Emma Bunton (\\\"Baby Spice\\\"), Geri Halliwell (\\\"Ginger Spice\\\"), and Victoria Beckham, n\\u00e9e Adams (\\\"Posh Spice\\\"). They were signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single \\\"Wannabe\\\" in 1996, which hit number one in 37 countries[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2999872.stm Simon Fuller: Guiding pop culture] BBC. Retrieved 18 September 2011 and established them as a global phenomenon. Their debut album Spice sold more than 31 million copies worldwide,  becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. Their follow up album Spiceworld sold over 20 million copies worldwide.   The Spice Girls have sold over 80 million records worldwide,  making them the best-selling female group of all time, one of the best-selling pop groups of all time,  and the biggest British pop phenomenon since Beatlemania.  \\n\\nMeasures of their success include international record sales, a 2007\\u20132008 reunion tour, merchandising, record-breaking achievements, iconic symbolism such as Halliwell's Union Jack dress representing \\\"girl power\\\", and a film, Spice World. The group became one of the most successful marketing engines ever, earning up to $75 million per year, with their global grosses estimated at $500\\u2013800 million between 1996 and 1998. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, the Spice Girls embraced merchandising and became a regular feature of the British and global press. In 1996, Top of the Pops magazine gave each member of the group aliases, which were adopted by the group and media. According to Rolling Stone journalist and biographer David Sinclair, \\\"Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh and Sporty were the most widely recognised group of individuals since John, Paul, George, and Ringo\\\".  With the \\\"girl power\\\" phenomenon, the Spice Girls were popular cultural icons of the 1990s.  They are cited as part of the 'second wave' 1990s British Invasion of the US. \\n\\nOn 8 July 2016, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell reunited as a trio under the name \\\"Spice Girls - GEM\\\". \\n\\nBand history\\n\\n1994\\u201396: Formation and early years\\n\\nIn the mid-1990s, family management team Bob Herbert and Chris Herbert of Heart Management decided to create a girl group to compete with popular boy bands, such as Take That and East 17, which dominated the pop music scene at the time.  In February 1994, together with financier Chic Murphy, they placed an advertisement in the trade magazine The Stage asking for singers to audition for an all-female pop band at Danceworks studios.Spice Girls Official. [http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline Timeline]. Retrieved 16 March 2009. Approximately 400 women attended the audition, during which they were placed in groups of ten and danced a routine to \\\"Stay\\\" by Eternal, followed by solo auditions in which they were asked to perform songs of their own choosing. After several weeks of deliberation, Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm and Michelle Stephenson were among twelve women chosen to a second round of auditions in April; Geri Halliwell also attended the second audition, despite missing the first one due to work.\\n\\nA week after the second audition, the women were asked to attend a recall at Nomis Studios in Shepherds Bush, performing \\\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\\\" on their own and in a group. During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected to the band, initially named Touch. The group moved to a house in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and spent most of 1994 training. During the first two months, they worked on demos at South Hill Park Recording Studios in Bracknell with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger Tim Hawes. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \\\"very, very young pop\\\";  one of the songs they recorded, \\\"Sugar and Spice\\\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. During the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with Emma Bunton, who came up with the band name Spice.\\n\\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and A&R men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \\\"overwhelmingly positive\\\" reaction.  Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.\\n\\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.  That same day, the group tracked down Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy, who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers Absolute, who in turn brought them to the attention of Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment, who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with Virgin Records in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as a rapper was already using the name \\\"Spice\\\". From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.\\n\\n1996\\u201397: Spice and breakthrough\\n\\n \\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \\\"Wannabe\\\" in the United Kingdom. In the weeks leading up to the release, the video for \\\"Wannabe\\\" (directed by Swedish commercials director Johan Camitz and shot in April at St Pancras Chambers in London), got a trial airing on music channel The Box. The video was an instant hit, and was aired up to seventy times a week at its peak. After the video was released, the Spice Girls had their first live TV slot on broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise. The first music press interview appears in Music Week. In July 1996, the group conducted their first interview with Paul Gorman, the contributing editor of music paper Music Week, at Virgin Records' Paris headquarters. His piece recognised that the Spice Girls were about to institute a change in the charts away from Britpop and towards out-and-out pop. He wrote: \\\"JUST WHEN BOYS with guitars threaten to rule pop life \\u2013 Damon's all over Smash Hits, Ash are big in Big! and Liam can't move for tabloid frenzy \\u2013 an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble.\\\"  The song entered the charts at number 3 before moving up to number 1 the following week and staying there for seven weeks. The song proved to be a global hit, hitting number one in 37 countries  and becoming not only the biggest selling debut single by an all-female group but also the biggest-selling single by an all-female group of all time. \\n\\nRiding a wave of publicity and hype, the group released their next singles in the UK and Europe; in October \\\"Say You'll Be There\\\" was released topping the charts at number one for two weeks. In December \\\"2 Become 1\\\" was released, becoming their first Christmas number one and selling 430,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest selling single of the year. The two tracks continued the group's remarkable sales by topping the charts in over fifty-three countries and cementing the group's reputation as the biggest pop act in the world. In November 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut album Spice in Europe. The success was unprecedented and drew comparisons to Beatlemania.  In seven weeks Spice had sold 1.8 million copies in Britain alone,[http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx UK Sales certificates database]. British Phonographic Industry. Retrieved 25 November 2009.  making the Spice Girls the fastest selling British act since the Beatles. In total, the album sold over 3 million copies in Britain, the biggest-selling album of all time in the UK by a female group,  certified 10\\u00d7 Platinum, and peaked at number one for fifteen non-consecutive weeks. In Europe the album became the biggest-selling album of 1997 and was certified 8\\u00d7 Platinum by the IFPI for sales in excess of 8 million copies. \\n\\nThat same month the Spice Girls attracted a crowd of 500,000 when they switched on the Christmas lights in Oxford Street, London.  At the same time, Simon Fuller started to set up million pound sponsorship deals for the Spice Girls with Pepsi, Walkers, Impulse, Cadbury's and Polaroid. In December 1996, the group won three trophies at the Smash Hits awards at the London Arena, including best video for \\\"Say You'll Be There\\\". In January 1997, the group released \\\"Wannabe\\\" in the United States.  The single, written by the Spice Girls, Richard Stannard, and Matt Rowe also proved to be a catalyst in helping the Spice Girls break into the notoriously difficult US market when it debuted on the Hot 100 Chart at number 11. At the time, this was the highest-ever debut by a non-American act, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for \\\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\\" and the joint highest entry for a debut act beating Alanis Morissette with \\\"Ironic\\\". \\\"Wannabe\\\" reached number one in the US for four weeks. In February 1997, Spice was released in the US, and became the biggest-selling album of 1997 in the US, peaking at number one, and was certified 7\\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA[http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp USA sales certificates database]. RIAA. Retrieved 10 March 2006.  for sales in excess of 7.4 million\\ncopies.  The album is also included in the Top 100 Albums of All Time list of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) based on US sales.  In total, the album sold 28 million copies worldwide becoming the biggest-selling album of all-time by an all-female group.\\n\\nLater that month, the Spice Girls won two Brit Awards for Best British Video, \\\"Say You'll Be There\\\" and Best British Single for \\\"Wannabe\\\".  The group performed \\\"Who Do You Think You Are\\\" to open the 1997 BRIT Awards with Geri Halliwell wearing a Union Jack mini-dress, causing it to become one of pop history's most famed outfits.  In March 1997, a double A-side of \\\"Mama\\\"/\\\"Who Do You Think You Are\\\" was released in Europe, the last from Spice, which once again saw them at number one,  making the Spice Girls the first group in history since the Jackson 5 to have four consecutive number one hits. Girl Power!, The Spice Girls' first book and manifesto was launched later that month at the Virgin Megastore. It sold 200,000 copies within a day, and was eventually translated into more than 20 languages. In April, Spice: the Official Video Volume One, was released, and sold half a million copies. In May, Spice World was announced by the Spice Girls at the Cannes Film Festival. The group also performed their first live British show, for the Royalty of Great Britain. At the show, they breached royal protocol when Mel B and then Geri Halliwell planted kisses on Prince Charles' cheeks and pinched his bottom, causing controversy. At the Ivor Novello Awards, the group won International Hit of the Year and Best-Selling British Single awards for \\\"Wannabe\\\". In June 1997, Spice World began filming and wrapped in August. In September, the Spice Girls performed \\\"Say You'll Be There\\\" at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won Best Dance Video for \\\"Wannabe\\\".  At the 1997 Billboard Music Awards the group won four awards; New Artist of the Year, Hot 100 Singles Group of the Year, Album Group of the Year, and Album of the Year for Spice. \\n\\n1997\\u201398: Groundbreaking success, Spiceworld and Halliwell's departure\\n\\nIn October 1997, the Spice Girls released the first single from Spiceworld, \\\"Spice Up Your Life\\\". It entered the UK Albums Chart at number one on 19 October 1997, making it the group's fifth consecutive number one hit single. That same month, Simon Fuller took the Spice Girls east to perform their first live major concert to 40,000 fans in Istanbul, Turkey. Later, the Girls travelled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, who announced, \\\"These are my heroes.\\\"  This was the year when the Spice Girls reached the height of their career. In November, the Spice Girls released their second album, Spiceworld. The album was a global best seller. It set a new record for the fastest-selling album when it shipped seven million copies over the course of two weeks. Gaining favourable reviews,  the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe,  Canada,[http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php CRIA Canadian sales certificates database]. Canadian Recording Industry Association. Retrieved 11 March 2006. and the United States\\ncombined, and 20 million copies worldwide.  Criticised in the United-States for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there, and suffering from over-exposure at home, the Spice Girls began to experience a media backlash. The group was criticised for the number of sponsorship deals signed \\u2014over twenty in total\\u2014and they began to witness diminishing international chart positions. Nevertheless, the Spice Girls remained the biggest-selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998.\\n\\nOn 7 November 1997, the group performed \\\"Spice Up Your Life\\\" in the 1997 MTV Europe Music Awards.  After this performance, the Spice Girls made the decision to take over the running of the group themselves, and fired their manager Simon Fuller. The firing was front page news around the world. Many commentators speculated that Fuller had been the true mastermind behind the group, and that this was the moment when the band lost their impetus and direction.  In December 1997, the second single from Spiceworld, \\\"Too Much\\\", was released. This became the second Christmas number one for the group and the sixth consecutive number one hit single in the UK. At the 1998 American Music Awards on 26 January, the Spice Girls won three awards; Favorite Pop Album, Favorite New Artist, and Favorite Pop Group.  In February 1998, the Spice Girls won a special award for overseas success at the 1998 BRIT Awards, with combined sales of albums and singles for over of 45 million records worldwide, as of 7 February 1998 according to Billboard.  That night, the group performed their next single, \\\"Stop\\\". This was their only track not to hit number one in Britain (it entered and peaked at number two). Further singles released from the album included \\\"Viva Forever\\\", which was scheduled to be released as a double A-side with \\\"Never Give Up on the Good Times\\\", but these plans were scrapped due to Halliwell's departure from the group in May 1998. The song became the seventh number one, and the video includes scenes of Halliwell stop motion animation.\\n\\nIn early 1998, the Spice Girls embarked upon the world tour that Fuller had set up for them covering Europe and North America. The Spiceworld Tour kicked off in Dublin, Ireland on 24 February 1998 before moving on to mainland Europe and then returning to Britain for two gigs at Wembley Arena  and Twelve gigs at Birmingham's NEC Arena. Performing to 150,000 fans over the course of the tour. It was here that recordings were made for a planned live album, which was confirmed by the group: \\\"We've shown everyone we can do the business on stage, so now we want to do a live album for fans\\\". Despite masters of the recording being made, the idea was eventually dropped. Later that year, the Spice Girls were invited to sing on the official England World Cup song \\\"How Does It Feel (To Be on Top of the World)\\\", however, it was derided by England football fans in favour of a re-release of the Lightning Seeds anthem \\\"Three Lions\\\", which comfortably beat it to No. 1 on the singles chart. This was also the last song the group recorded with Geri's vocals until 2007. On 31 May 1998, Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls. Through her solicitor (i.e. lawyer) she stated: \\\"Sadly I would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls. This is because of differences between us. I'm sure the group will continue to be successful and I wish them all the best.\\\"  Halliwell claimed that she was suffering from exhaustion and wanted to take a break. Halliwell's departure from the group shocked fans, in the middle of rumours of fight with Mel B, the news of Halliwell's departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world, it made the covers of the most important tabloid and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year,  making news headlines the world over. Geri went on to launch an initially successful solo career.\\n\\nThe four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on and that their approaching North American tour would continue as normal, however, Halliwell's departure threw most of the group's plans into disarray. It also meant that most of the material the group had recorded throughout the first half of 1998 at Dublin's Windmill Lane Studios with long-time collaborators Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe was eventually scrapped. A rumoured animated venture by Disney also failed to materialise. Finally, Halliwell's departure was the subject of a lawsuit by Aprilia World Service BV, a manufacturer of motorcycles and scooters. On 9 March 1998, Halliwell informed the other members of the group of her intention to withdraw from the group, yet the girls signed an agreement with AWS on 24 March and again on 30 April and participated in a commercial photo shoot on 4 May in Milan, eventually concluding a contract with AWS on 6 May 1998. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that their conduct constituted a misrepresentation, allowing AWS to rescind their contract with the Spice Girls. This is now the leading case in English law on misrepresentation by conduct.   \\\"Viva Forever\\\" was the last single taken off Spiceworld. The video for the single was made before Geri's departure and features the girls in animated form \\u2013 a decision made because there was no time to produce a video due to the heavy world tour schedule. Originally planned as a double A-side with \\\"Never Give Up on the Good Times\\\", the idea was dropped for several reasons, mainly due to time restraints (since there was no time to re-record and edit out Halliwell's vocals or make a video for the track). The North American tour was a big success, began in West Palm Beach on 15 June, and grossed $60 million in 40-date sold-out. \\n\\n1998\\u20132000: Forever and indefinite hiatus\\n\\nWhile on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and they released a new song, \\\"Goodbye\\\", before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri Halliwell, and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one \\u2013 equalling the record previously set by The Beatles. Later in 1998, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: \\\"Best Pop Act\\\" and \\\"Best Group\\\" for a second time.  In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant at the time, the former was also married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999.  One month later, Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn, whose father was then Manchester United player David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland. \\n\\nThe Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an eight-month recording break to start work on their third and last studio album. The album's sound was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy.  The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, named Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, also showcasing new songs from the third album.  During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song \\\"My Strongest Suit\\\" in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida, a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's Aida. The band performed again at the 2000 BRIT Awards, and it was announced that they had received the Outstanding Achievement in Music Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage.  In November 2000, the group released Forever. Sporting a new edgier R&B sound, the album received a lukewarm response from critics. \\n\\nIn the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's Coast to Coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number two.  The lead single from Forever, the double A-side \\\"Holler\\\"/\\\"Let Love Lead the Way\\\", became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. \\\"Holler\\\" did peak at number thirty-one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2000. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000.  In total, Forever achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting. \\n\\n2007\\u201308: Return of the Spice Girls and Greatest Hits\\n\\nOn 28 June 2007, the group held a press conference at The O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite.  The plan to reform had long been speculated by the media,  but the group finally confirmed their intention to embark upon a worldwide concert tour, starting in Vancouver on 2 December 2007.  Filmmaker Bob\\nSmeaton, directed an official documentary on the reunion. It was entitled Spice Girls: Giving You Everything and was first aired on Australia's Fox8 on 16 December 2007,  followed by BBC One in the UK, on 31 December.  Ticket sales for the first London date of \\\"The Return of the Spice Girls\\\" World Tour sold out in 38 seconds. It was reported that over one million people signed up in the UK alone and over five million worldwide for the ticket ballot on the band's official website.BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7021976.stm Fans snap up Spice Girls tickets]. BBC. Retrieved 14 October 2007. Sixteen additional dates in London had been added  and sold out. In the United States, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Jose shows also sold out, prompting additional dates to be added.  It was announced that the\\nSpice Girls would be playing dates in Chicago and Detroit (Auburn Hills) and Boston, as well as additional dates in New York to keep up with the demand. On the first concert in Canada, they performed to an audience of 15,000 people, singing twenty songs and changing a total of eight times.  Along with the tour sellout, the Spice Girls licensed their name and image to Tesco's UK supermarket chain. \\n\\nThe group's comeback single, \\\"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\\\", was announced as the official Children in Need charity single for 2007 and was released 5 November. The first public appearance on stage by the Spice Girls was made at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, where the group performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. They performed two songs, 1998 single \\\"Stop\\\" and the lead single from their greatest hits album, \\\"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\\\". The show was filmed by CBS on 15 November 2007 for broadcast on 4 December 2007.  They also performed the song live for the BBC Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2007 from Los Angeles, in Roberto Cavalli gowns. The release peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the group's lowest charting British single to date. However, the album fared better, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 February 2008, it was announced that due to personal and family commitments their tour would come to an end in Toronto on 26 February 2008, meaning that tour dates in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Cape Town and Buenos Aires were cancelled.BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7223629.stm Spice Girls cut short world tour]. BBC. Retrieved 2 February 2008. In March 2008, the group won the coveted \\\"Icon Awards\\\" at the 95.8 Capital Awards; Bunton and Chisholm collected the award. In June, they captured the Glamour Award for the Best Band; Bunton, Brown and Halliwell received the award at the event. In September, the Spice Girls won the \\\"Best Live Return Award\\\" at the 2008 Live Vodafone Music Awards, beating acts such as Led Zeppelin and the Sex Pistols. Bunton was there to collect the award. \\n\\n2010\\u201312: Viva Forever musical and London Olympics\\n\\nIn 2010, the group was nominated for a BRIT Award in the new category, \\\"Best Performance of the 30th Year\\\" for their Brit Awards performance of their songs, \\\"Wannabe\\\" and \\\"Who Do You Think You Are\\\". The group later won the award which was received by Halliwell and Brown. The group along with Simon Fuller also teamed with Judy Craymer and Jennifer Saunders to develop a Spice Girls musical entitled Viva Forever!. Although the group were not in the musical, they influenced the show's cast and production choices in a story which uses; similar to that of ABBA's music in Mamma Mia!. \\n\\nTwo years later, in June 2012, the group reunited for the first time in four years for the press conference in London to promote the launch of Viva Forever: The Musical.  The press conference was held at St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, the location where the group filmed the music video for \\\"Wannabe\\\", sixteen years earlier, to the day.  In August 2012, after much speculation from the press and the public, the group performed a medley of \\\"Wannabe\\\" and \\\"Spice Up Your Life\\\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting solely for the event.  Their performance received great response from the audience and became the most tweeted moment of the Olympics with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute.  In December 2012, the group reunited once again for the premiere of Viva Forever: The Musical at the West End's Piccadilly Theatre.  In addition to the promotion of the musical, the group appeared in the documentary, Spice Girls' Story: Viva Forever! which aired on 24 December 2012 on ITV1.\\n\\n2016: Spice Girls - GEM \\n\\nOn 8 July 2016, Mel B, Bunton and Halliwell unveiled a new website and released a short video celebrating the 20th anniversary of their first single \\\"Wannabe\\\", and teasing upcoming news from them as a three piece called Spice Girls - GEM. \\n\\nCultural impact and legacy\\n\\nBritish music scene\\n\\nThe image of the Spice Girls was deliberately aimed at young girls, an audience of formidable size and potential; reinforcing the range of appeal within the target demographic were the bandmates' five distinctive personalities, which encouraged fans to identify with one member or another. This marketing was helped in no small way by the aliases assigned to each member of the group, similar to the marketing ploy used in children's serial literature of including several different character types in the storyline. Shortly after \\\"Wannabe\\\"'s release, the group appeared in Top of the Pops magazine where each member was given a nickname based upon her image: Adams became \\\"Posh Spice\\\", Bunton became \\\"Baby Spice\\\", Brown became \\\"Scary Spice\\\", Halliwell became \\\"Ginger Spice\\\", and Chisholm became \\\"Sporty Spice\\\". \\n\\n\\\"Girl power\\\"\\n\\nThe phrase \\\"girl power\\\" put a name to a social phenomenon, but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world: both Madonna and Bananarama had employed similar outlooks. The phrase, whilst coined by Welsh indie band Helen Love in 1993  and used as the title of an album by British pop duo Shampoo in 1995, had been used in 1987 by a London a capella all-girl group called Mint Juleps. With the production might of Trevor Horn behind them, this group had released a track called \\\"Girl to the Power of 6\\\". The format of the song, whilst having an obvious 1980s sound, had a similar format to the Spice Girls' \\\"Wannabe\\\", where each girl presented a distinct personality trait. The phrases \\\"Girl to the Power\\\" and \\\"Girl Power\\\" are mentioned several times, as well as strong overtones of female empowerment, unity and loyalty. However, the formula did not work for the Mint Juleps, perhaps being too far ahead of its time. It was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with \\\"Wannabe\\\", over 9 years later, that the concept of \\\"Girl power\\\" exploded onto the common consciousness. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women, and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.\\n\\nIn all, the focused, consistent presentation of \\\"girl power\\\" formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band.  Some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the Oxford English Dictionary. \\nIn summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, \\\"The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.\\\" \\n\\nCool Britannia\\n\\n \\nThe term \\\"Cool Britannia\\\" became prominent in the media and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by New Labour and the new UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Coming out of a period of 18 years of Conservative government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and very appealing, a main driving force in giving Britain a feeling of euphoria and optimism. \\n\\nAlthough by no means responsible for the onset of \\\"Cool Britannia\\\", the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than American pop music. This fact was underlined at the 1997 BRIT Awards. The group won two awards  but it was Halliwell's now iconic red, white and blue Union Jack mini-dress that appeared in media coverage around the world and became an enduring image of \\\"Cool Britannia\\\".  \\n\\n1990s iconic status\\n\\nThe Union Jack dress that Halliwell wore has achieved iconic status, becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture. The dress was sold at a charity auction to Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for a record \\u00a341,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold  after interest from a frenzy of bidders.  The dress was one of many items of Spice Girls memorabilia sold at the auction, where total sales reached \\u00a3146,511 for charity.\\n\\nThe iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is also attributed to their merchandising and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world. They advertised for many brands and even parodied themselves in the video for the song \\\"Spice Up Your Life\\\", in which the band fly in a space ship surrounded by billboards and adverts featuring them. Because of their regular appearances in ads and the media, the band solidified themselves as a phenomenon\\u2014an icon of the decade and for British music. The Spice Girls ranked No. 10 in The 101 Reasons the '90s Ruled, special for TV channel E!. \\n\\nSome sources, especially those in the United Kingdom, revere the Spice Girls as \\\"gay icons\\\". In a survey in which more than 5,000 male and female homosexually oriented individuals from the UK had voted, Victoria Beckham placed 12th and Geri Halliwell placed 43rd in the Top 50 gay icons of all time.  Halliwell joked at the Video Music Awards in 1998 about her appearance as Ginger Spice: \\\"As you have noted, I am no longer dressed like a drag queen.\\\"  During an interview, Emma Bunton explained why the Spice Girls have so many gay fans: \\\"We were really flattered with having such a huge gay fan base because they know about fashion and they know about songs ... I'm so flattered that we've got such a huge gay following, it's amazing.\\\" \\n\\nTen years after the release of their debut single, the Spice Girls were voted the biggest cultural icons of the 1990s by 80 percent in a UK poll of 1,000 people carried out for the board game Trivial Pursuit, stating that \\\"Girl Power\\\" defined the decade.\\n\\nSpicy Crispy Chicks\\n\\nIn 1997, Jack in the Box, an American fast-food chain restaurant, sought to capitalise on Spice Girl Mania in America, by launching a major advertising campaign using a fictional musical group called the 'Spicy Crispy Chicks' (a take off of the Spice Girls). The comedic national television commercials were used to promote the new 'Spicy Crispy Sandwich', with the girls mimicking the Spice Girls, dancing in \\\"the Jack groove.\\\" The Spicy Crispy Chicks concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the 'Meaty Cheesy Boys'.  At the 1998 Association of Independent Commercial Producers (AICP) Show, one of the Spicy Crispy Chicks commercials won the top award for humour. \\n\\nFashion trends and nicknames\\n\\nIn the summer of 1996 a lunch at a Notting Hill restaurant with the editor of Top of the Pops magazine, Peter Loraine would inadvertently lead the Spice Girls to adopt nicknames. The nicknames played a key role in their marketability and the way their international audience would identify with them. \\n\\n\\\"In the magazine we used silly language and came up with nicknames all the time so it came naturally to give them names that would be used by the magazine and its readers; it was never meant to be adopted globally,\\\" he explains.\\n\\n*Victoria Beckham: Victoria was called Posh Spice because of her more upper-middle-class background, her choppy brunette bob hairstyle and refined attitude, form-fitting designer outfits and her love of high-heeled footwear.\\n*Melanie Brown: Melanie (also called Mel B) was given the nickname Scary Spice because of her outrageous, \\\"in-your-face\\\" attitude, \\\"loud\\\" Leeds accent, throaty laugh, pierced tongue, manner of dress (which often consisted of leopard-print outfits), and her voluminously curly Afro hair.\\n*Emma Bunton: Emma was called Baby Spice because she was the youngest member of the group, wore her long blonde hair in pigtails, wore babydoll dresses, had an innocent smile, and had a girly girl personality.\\n*Melanie Chisholm: Melanie (also called Mel C) was called Sporty Spice because she usually wore a tracksuit with her long dark hair in a ponytail and sported a tough girl attitude as well as tattoos on both of her arms. She also possessed true athletic abilities, her signature being her ability to perform back handsprings.\\n*Geri Halliwell: Geri was called Ginger Spice because of her \\\"liveliness, zest, and flaming red hair.\\\" She often wore outrageous stage outfits, as in the iconic Union Jack dress. Geri was seen by some as the de facto leader of the group thanks to her articulate conversational style and business savvy nature. She was also the eldest member of the group.\\n\\nPortrayal in the media\\n\\nThe Spice Girls became media icons in Great Britain and a regular feature of the British press; during the peak of their worldwide fame in 1997, the paparazzi were constantly seen following them everywhere,  to obtain stories and gossip about the group, as a supposed affair between Emma Bunton and manager Simon Fuller, or constant split rumours  which became fodder for numerous tabloids.  Rumours of in-fighting and conflicts within the group also made headlines, especially between Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown; the rumours suggested that they were fighting to be the leader of the group. Brown, who later admitted that she used to be a \\\"bitch\\\" with Halliwell, said the problems had stayed in the past.  The rumours reached their height when the Spice Girls dismissed their manager Simon Fuller during the power struggles, with Fuller reportedly receiving a 10 million pound severance cheque to keep quiet about the details of his sacking.  Months later, in May 1998, Halliwell would leave the band in the midst of rumours of fighting with Brown; the news of Halliwell's departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world, and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year.\\n\\nIn February 1997 at the BRIT Awards, Halliwell's Union Jack dress from a Spice Girls live performance made all the front pages the next day. During the ceremony, Halliwell's breasts were exposed twice, causing controversy. This would not be the only such exhibition published of Halliwell, because during the year the release of nude photos of Halliwell that she posed for earlier in her career caused some scandal. According to the documentary Giving You Everything, the rest of the women stated that they knew about the photos before they were famous, but when the photos were published they created friction inside the group that never abated.\\n\\nThe stories of their encounters with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince's Trust 21st anniversary concert, Mel B and Geri Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles's cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him \\\"you're very sexy\\\" and also pinched his bottom.  In November, the British Royal Family were considered fans of the Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his son Prince Harry.   That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: \\\"These are my heroes. This is one of the greatest moments in my life\\\"  in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, \\\"It is the second greatest moment in my life, the first time I met them was the greatest\\\". In 1998 the video game magazine Nintendo Power created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: \\\"What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?\\\" \\n\\nVictoria Adams started dating football player David Beckham in 1997 after they had met at a charity football match.  The couple announced their engagement in 1998  and were dubbed \\\"Posh and Becks\\\" by the media. \\n\\nOther brand ventures\\n\\nFilm\\n\\nIn June 1997, the group began filming their movie debut with director Bob Spiers. Meant to accompany the album, the comical style and content of the movie was in the same vein as The Beatles' films in the 1960s such as A Hard Day's Night. The light-hearted comedy, intended to capture the spirit of the Spice Girls, featured a plethora of stars including Roger Moore, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Elton John, Richard O'Brien, Jennifer Saunders, Richard E. Grant, Elvis Costello, and Meat Loaf. Released in December 1997, Spiceworld: The Movie proved to be a hit at the box office, breaking the record for the highest-ever weekend debut for Super Bowl Weekend (25 January 1998) in the US, with box office sales of $10,527,222.  The movie took in total $77 million at the box office worldwide,   $100 million combining cinema tickets and DVD sales,  including $30 million in the US and \\u00a311 million in Britain. Despite being a commercial success, the film was widely panned by critics; the movie was nominated for seven awards at the 1999 Golden Raspberry Awards where the Spice Girls collectively won the award for \\\"Worst Actress\\\". \\n\\nSince 18 July 2014, The Spice Bus, which featured in the film driven by Meat Loaf, is now on permanent display at the Island Harbour Marina on the Isle of Wight, England.\\n\\nTelevision\\n\\nThe first television special that the Spice Girls filmed was a documentary of their experiences from 1996 to 1997, titled One Hour of Girl Power.  Later, Girl Talk was released. It was a television special where the Spice Girls spoke individually about themselves and the group.  In April 1997, The Spice Girls appeared on the popular American television show Saturday Night Live,  singing \\\"Wannabe\\\" and \\\"Say You'll Be There\\\".  In November 1997, An Audience with...The Spice Girls was screened for British channel ITV. They also sang the song \\\"Power of Five\\\" on the day Channel 5 launched.  The show attracted 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the population. In December 1997 was the release of the first US television documentary Too Much Is Never Enough, focusing on their reaction to their sudden rise to fame around the world.  In January 1998, the Spice Girls appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, singing two songs, followed by an interview with Oprah.\\n\\nIn June 1999 the TV special, The Spice Girls in America: A Tour Story was aired. This followed the Spice Girls' exploits and adventures in America, focusing on their tour of the US,  and when Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls. In December 2000, T4 aired a documentary, \\\"Spice Girls on Film\\\", which focused on the Spice Girls' music videos.  In November 2003, Melanie C and Geri appeared on the VH1 television series Behind the Music which devoted a chapter to tell the story of the Spice Girls, as well as E! True Hollywood Story, the TV documentary series on the cable network E!.\\n\\nThe first public appearance on stage by the Spice Girls Reunion was made at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, where the group performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. They performed two songs, 1998 single \\\"Stop\\\" and the lead single from their greatest hits album, \\\"Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)\\\". The show was filmed by CBS on 15 November 2007 for broadcast on 4 December 2007, the show attracts averaged 7.4 million total viewers. \\n\\nIn December 2007, the official documentary, Spice Girls: Giving You Everything that made its world premi\\u00e8re in Australia on FOX8, It aired in Canada on 19 December 2007 (on the CTV), and on the BBC in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2007. The film features narrative insight and commentary from the five girls themselves. The title of the documentary comes from chorus lyrics from their UK No. 1 single \\\"Say You'll Be There\\\". The documentary attracted 3.6 million viewers in the UK. \\n\\nViva Forever: The Musical\\n\\nA jukebox musical written by Jennifer Saunders, produced by Judy Craymer and directed by Paul Garrington.

The group responded to the presses criticisms by launching a music video of \\\"Spice Up Your Life\\\" where they are seen referring to the number of sponsorships they had.\\n* Cadbury Chocolate: 10 chocolate bars, assorted boxes and holiday confectioneries including easter eggs featuring the girls individually or as a group were produced.\\n* Chupa Chups: Different tins filled with assorted lollipops featuring a different girl were among the many products released, but the most widely produced was the \\\"Fantasy Ball\\\" Chupa Chups with six different packages each featuring a collectible sticker.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.  Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe\\u2014a concept dating back to classical antiquity\\u2014are arbitrary; the primarily physiographic term \\\"continent\\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current boundaries.\\n\\nEurope is the world's second-smallest continent by surface area, covering about  or 2% of the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population, while Vatican City is the smallest both in terms of area and population. Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa, with a population of 739\\u2013743\\u00a0million or about 11% of the world's population.  Europe has a climate heavily affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the Atlantic, seasonal differences are mildly greater than close to the coast.\\n\\nEurope, in particular ancient Greece, is the birthplace of Western civilization.    The fall of the Western Roman Empire, during the migration period, marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the \\\"Middle Ages\\\". The Renaissance humanism, exploration, art, and science led the \\\"old continent\\\", and eventually the rest of the world, to the modern era. From this period onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various times the Americas, most of Africa, Oceania, and the majority of Asia.\\n\\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in the United Kingdom at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually the wider world. Both world wars were largely focused upon Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the United States and Soviet Union took prominence.  During the Cold War, Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east, until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall.\\n\\nEuropean integration led to the formation of the European Union, a political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation.  The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the Euro, is the most commonly used among Europeans and the EU's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states.\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nClickable map of Europe, showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries  Key: blue: states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia;\\ngreen: states not geographically in Europe, but closely associated with the continent\\n\\nThe use of the term \\\"Europe\\\" has developed gradually throughout history.   In antiquity, the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the River Phasis forming their boundaries\\u2014though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.  Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don.  The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia. \\n\\nA cultural definition of Europe as the lands of Latin Christendom coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with Byzantium and Islam, and limited to northern Iberia, the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.  The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the Carolingian Renaissance: \\\"Europa\\\" often figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, Alcuin.  This division\\u2014as much cultural as geographical\\u2014was used until the Late Middle Ages, when it was challenged by the Age of Discovery.   The problem of redefining Europe was finally resolved in 1730 when, instead of waterways, the Swedish geographer and cartographer von Strahlenberg proposed the Ural Mountains as the most significant eastern boundary, a suggestion that found favour in Russia and throughout Europe. \\n\\nEurope is now generally defined by geographers as the western part of Eurasia, with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea; to the southeast, including the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. \\n\\nIslands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence Iceland is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of Greenland is usually assigned to North America.  Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. Cyprus is closest to Anatolia (or Asia Minor), but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and currently is a member state of the EU. Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries. \\n\\nThe geographic boundary drawn between Europe and Asia in 1730 follows no international boundaries.  As a result, attempts to organise Europe along political or economic lines have resulted in uses of the name in a geopolitically limiting way  to refer only to the 28 member states of the European Union. Conversely, Europe has also been used in a very expansive way by the Council of Europe which has 47 member countries, some of which territorially over-reach the Ural and Bosphorus lines to include all of Russia and Turkey. In addition, people in the British Isles may refer to \\\"continental\\\" or \\\"mainland\\\" Europe as Europe. \\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nIn classical Greek mythology, Europa was a Phoenician princess whom Zeus abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull. He took her to the island of Crete where she gave birth to Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon. For Homer, Europe (, Eur\\u1e53p\\u0113; see also List of Greek place names) was a mythological queen of Crete, not a geographical designation.\\n\\nThe etymology of Europe is uncertain.  One theory suggests that it is derived from the Greek \\u03b5\\u1f50\\u03c1\\u03cd\\u03c2 (eurus), meaning \\\"wide, broad\\\"  and \\u1f64\\u03c8/\\u1f60\\u03c0-/\\u1f40\\u03c0\\u03c4- (\\u014dps/\\u014dp-/opt-), meaning \\\"eye, face, countenance\\\",  hence Eur\\u1e53p\\u0113, \\\"wide-gazing\\\", \\\"broad of aspect\\\" (compare with glauk\\u014dpis (\\u03b3\\u03bb\\u03b1\\u03c5\\u03ba\\u1ff6\\u03c0\\u03b9\\u03c2 'grey-eyed') Athena or bo\\u014dpis (\\u03b2\\u03bf\\u1f60\\u03c0\\u03b9\\u03c2 'ox-eyed') Hera). Broad has been an epithet of Earth herself in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion.  Another theory suggests that it is based on a Semitic word such as the Akkadian erebu meaning \\\"to go down, set\\\"  (in reference to the sun), cognate to Phoenician  'ereb \\\"evening; west\\\" and Arabic Maghreb, Hebrew ma'arav (see also Erebus, PIE *h1reg\\u02b7os, \\\"darkness\\\"). Martin Litchfield West states that \\\"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor\\\".  However, Michael A. Barry, professor in Princeton University's Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word Ereb on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of \\\"night\\\", \\\"[the country of] sunset\\\", in opposition to Asu \\\"[the country of] sunrise\\\", i.e. Asia (Anatolia coming equally from \\u1f08\\u03bd\\u03b1\\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03bb\\u03ae, \\\"(sun)rise\\\", \\\"east\\\").  In the Homeric Hymns written in the seventh century BC, Eur\\u00f4p\\u00e8 still represents, the western shore of the Aegean Sea.\\n\\nWhatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure, \\u0395\\u1f50\\u03c1\\u03ce\\u03c0\\u03b7 is first used as a geographical term in the 6th century BC, by Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC.  But the convention received by the Middle Ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the Roman era used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,  Strabo  and Ptolemy, \\nwho took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.\\n\\nThe term \\\"Europe\\\" is first used for a cultural sphere in the Carolingian Renaissance of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the Western Church, as opposed to both the Eastern Orthodox churches and to the Islamic world. The modern convention, enlarging the area of \\\"Europe\\\" somewhat to the east and the southeast, develops in the 19th century.\\n\\nMost major world languages use words derived from \\\"Europa\\\" to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word \\u014cuzh\\u014du (\\u6b50\\u6d32/\\u6b27\\u6d32); a similar Chinese-derived term  is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, , despite the katakana  being more commonly used. However, in some Turkic languages the originally Persian name Frangistan (land of the Franks) is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as Avrupa or Evropa. \\n\\nHistory\\n\\nPrehistory\\n\\nHomo erectus georgicus, which lived roughly 1.8\\u00a0million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest hominid to have been discovered in Europe.  Other hominid remains, dating back roughly 1\\u00a0million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6256356.stm The million year old tooth from ]Atapuerca, Spain, found in June 2007 Neanderthal man (named after the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about 28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and their final refuge being present-day Portugal. The Neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans (Cro-Magnons), who appeared in Europe around 43 to 40 thousand years ago. \\n\\nThe European Neolithic period\\u2014marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery\\u2014began around 7000 BC in Greece and the Balkans, probably influenced by earlier farming practices in Anatolia and the Near East.  It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine (Linear Pottery culture) and along the Mediterranean coast (Cardial culture). Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds and megalithic tombs. The Corded Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed throughout Western and Southern Europe.  \\n\\nThe European Bronze Age began c. 3200 BC in Greece with the Minoan civilization on Crete, the first advanced civilization in Europe.   The Minoans were followed by the Myceneans, who collapsed suddenly around 1200 BC, ushering the European Iron Age.  Iron Age colonisation by the Greeks and Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities. Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BC gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity, whose beginning is sometimes dated to 776 BC, the year the first Olympic Games. \\n\\nClassical antiquity\\n\\nAncient Greece was the founding culture of Western civilisation. Western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to Ancient Greece.  The Greeks city-state, the polis, was the fundamental political unit of classical Greece. In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in Athens.   The Greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late 18th century by European philosophers and idealists. Greece also generated many cultural contributions: in philosophy, humanism and rationalism under Aristotle, Socrates and Plato; in history with Herodotus and Thucydides; in dramatic and narrative verse, starting with the epic poems of Homer;  in drama with Sophocles and Euripides, in medicine with Hippocrates and Galen; and in science with Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes.  In the course of the 5th century BC, several of the Greek city states would ultimately check the Achaemenid Persian advance in Europe through the Greco-Persian Wars, considered a pivotal moment in world history,  as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greece that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.\\n\\nGreece was followed by Rome, which left its mark on law, politics, language, engineering, architecture, government and many more key aspects in western civilisation. Expanding from their base in Italy beginning in the 3rd century BC, the Romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire Mediterranean basin and western Europe by the turn of the millennium.  The Roman Republic ended in 27 BC, when Augustus proclaimed the Roman Empire.  The two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana, a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and political stability in most of Europe. \\n\\nThe empire continued to expand under emperors such as Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius, who all spent time on the Empire's northern border fighting Germanic, Pictish and Scottish tribes.   The Empire began to decline in the 3rd century, particularly in the west. Christianity was legalised by Constantine I in 313 AD after three centuries of imperial persecution. Constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from Rome to the city of Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople in his honour (modern-day Istanbul) in 330 AD.  Christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in 380 AD, and in 391-392 AD, the emperor Theodosius outlawed pagan religions.  This is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity; alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD; the closure of the pagan Platonic Academy of Athens in 529 AD;  or the rise of Islam in the early 7th century AD.\\n\\nEarly Middle Ages\\n\\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire, Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the \\\"Age of Migrations\\\". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Slavs, Avars, Bulgars and, later on, the Vikings, Pechenegs, Cumans  and Magyars. Renaissance thinkers such as Petrarch would later refer to this as the \\\"Dark Ages\\\".  Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire. \\n\\nWhile the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire.  During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe.  Emperor Justinian I presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the Hagia Sophia, and brought the Christian church under state control. \\n\\nFrom the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring Sasanid Persians were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent Byzantine\\u2013Sasanian wars, the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into Asia Minor. In the mid 7th century AD, following the Muslim conquest of Persia, Islam penetrated into the Caucasus region.  Over the next centuries Muslim forces took Cyprus, Malta, Crete, Sicily and parts of southern Italy.  Between 711 and 720, most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule\\u00a0\\u2014 save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. This territory, under the Arabic name Al-Andalus, became part of the expanding Umayyad Caliphate. The unsuccessful second siege of Constantinople (717) weakened the Umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the Frankish leader Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, which ended their northward advance.\\n\\nDuring the Dark Ages, the Western Roman Empire fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.  Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under Clovis\\u00a0I.  Charlemagne, a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed \\\"Holy Roman Emperor\\\" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the Holy Roman Empire, which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe. \\n\\nEast Central Europe saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of Christianity (circa 1000 AD). The powerful West Slavic state of Great Moravia spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under Svatopluk I and causing a series of armed conflicts with East Francia. Further south, the first South Slavic states emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted Christianity: the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Principality (later Kingdom and Empire), and the Duchy of Croatia (later Kingdom of Croatia). To the East, the Kievan Rus expanded from its capital in Kiev to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, Vladimir the Great adopted Orthodox Christianity as the religion of state. Further East, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later. \\n\\nHigh and Late Middle Ages\\n\\nThe period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the High Middle Ages, during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the Renaissance of the 12th century.  Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the Maritime Republics a leading role in the European scene.\\n\\nThe Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. Feudalism developed in France in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.  A struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in England led to the writing of the Magna Carta and the establishment of a parliament.  The primary source of culture in this period came from the Roman Catholic Church. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.\\n\\nThe Papacy reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An East-West Schism in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the Eastern Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 Pope Urban II called for a crusade against Muslims occupying Jerusalem and the Holy Land.  In Europe itself, the Church organised the Inquisition against heretics. In Spain, the Reconquista concluded with the fall of Granada in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula. \\n\\nIn the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans.  Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.   The Empire was weakened following the defeat at Manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of Constantinople in 1204, during the Fourth Crusade.           Although it would recover Constantinople in 1261, Byzantium fell in 1453 when Constantinople was taken by the Ottoman Empire.   \\n\\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the Pechenegs and the Cuman-Kipchaks, caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the Rus' state to the south and east.  Like many other parts of Eurasia, these territories were overrun by the Mongols.  The invaders, who became known as Tatars, were mostly Turkic-speaking peoples under Mongol suzerainty. They established the state of the Golden Horde with headquarters in Crimea, which later adopted Islam as a religion and ruled over modern-day southern and central Russia for more than three centuries.   After the collapse of Mongol dominions, the first Romanian states (principalities) emerged in the 14th century: Moldova and Walachia. Previously, these territories were under the successive control of Pechenegs and Cumans.   From the 12th to the 15th centuries, the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew from a small principality under Mongol rule to the largest state in Europe, overthrowing the Mongols in 1480 and eventually becoming the Tsardom of Russia. The state was consolidated under Ivan III the Great and Ivan the Terrible, steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.\\n\\nThe Great Famine of 1315\\u20131317 was the first crisis that would strike Europe in the late Middle Ages.  The period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss. The population of France was reduced by half.   Medieval Britain was afflicted by 95 famines,  and France suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period.  Europe was devastated in the mid-14th century by the Black Death, one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated 25\\u00a0million people in Europe alone\\u2014a third of the European population at the time. \\n\\nThe plague had a devastating effect on Europe's social structure; it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by Giovanni Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353). It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and led to increased persecution of Jews, foreigners, beggars and lepers.  The plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the 18th century.  During this period, more than 100 plague epidemics swept across Europe. \\n\\nEarly modern period\\n\\nThe Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in Florence and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical Greek and Arabic knowledge from monastic libraries, often translated from Arabic into Latin.   The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of art, philosophy, music, and the sciences, under the joint patronage of royalty, the nobility, the Roman Catholic Church, and an emerging merchant class.    Patrons in Italy, including the Medici family of Florentine bankers and the Popes in Rome, funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci.  \\n\\nPolitical intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the Western Schism. During this forty-year period, two popes\\u2014one in Avignon and one in Rome\\u2014claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly. \\n\\nThe Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517\\u20131648), initially sparked by the works of German theologian Martin Luther, an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths.  This eventually led to the Thirty Years War (1618\\u20131648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of Germany, killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.  In the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, France rose to predominance within Europe. \\n\\nThe 17th century in southern, central and eastern Europe was a period of general decline.  Central and Eastern Europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200-year period between 1501 and 1700.  From the 15th to 18th centuries, when the disintegrating khanates of the Golden Horde were conquered by Russia, Tatars from the Crimean Khanate frequently raided Eastern Slavic lands to capture slaves.  Further east, the Nogai Horde and Kazakh Khanate frequently raided the Slavic-speaking areas of Russia, Ukraine and Poland for hundreds of years, until the Russian expansion and conquest of most of northern Eurasia (i.e. Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia). Meanwhile, in the south, the Ottomans had conquered the Balkans by the 15th century, laying siege to Vienna in 1529.  In the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Holy League checked Ottoman power in the Mediterranean.  The Ottomans again laid siege to Vienna in 1683, but the Battle of Vienna permanently ended their advance into Europe, and marked the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in central Europe.\\n\\nThe Renaissance and the New Monarchs marked the start of an Age of Discovery, a period of exploration, invention, and scientific development.  Among the great figures of the Western scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Isaac Newton.  According to Peter Barrett, \\\"It is widely accepted that 'modern science' arose in the Europe of the 17th century (towards the end of the Renaissance), introducing a new understanding of the natural world.\\\"  In the 15th century, Portugal and Spain, two of the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.   Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and Vasco da Gama opened the ocean route to the East in 1498, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing colonial empires in the Americas and Asia.  France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.\\n\\n18th and 19th centuries\\n\\nThe Age of Enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the 18th century promoting scientific and reason-based thoughts.    Discontent with the aristocracy and clergy's monopoly on political power in France resulted in the French Revolution and the establishment of the First Republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror.  Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution and established the First French Empire that, during the Napoleonic Wars, grew to encompass large parts of Europe before collapsing in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo.   Napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the French Revolution, including that of the nation-state, as well as the widespread adoption of the French models of administration, law, and education.    The Congress of Vienna, convened after Napoleon's downfall, established a new balance of power in Europe centred on the five \\\"Great Powers\\\": the UK, France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia.  This balance would remain in place until the Revolutions of 1848, during which liberal uprisings affected all of Europe except for Russia and the UK. These revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted.  The year 1859 saw the unification of Romania, as a nation-state, from smaller principalities. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire was formed; and 1871 saw the unifications of both Italy and Germany as nation-states from smaller principalities. \\n\\nIn parallel, the Eastern Question grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768\\u20131774). As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) marked the beginning of the end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912-1913.  Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.\\n\\nThe Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain in the last part of the 18th century and spread throughout Europe. The invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth, mass employment, and the rise of a new working class.  Reforms in social and economic spheres followed, including the first laws on child labour, the legalisation of trade unions,  and the abolition of slavery.  In Britain, the Public Health Act of 1875 was passed, which significantly improved living conditions in many British cities.  Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.  The last major famine recorded in Western Europe, the Irish Potato Famine, caused death and mass emigration of millions of Irish people.  In the 19th century, 70\\u00a0million people left Europe in migrations to various European colonies abroad and to the United States.  Demographic growth meant that, by 1900, Europe's share of the world's population was 25%. \\n\\n20th century to the present\\n\\nTwo World Wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918. It started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated by the Yugoslav nationalist  Gavrilo Princip.  Most European nations were drawn into the war, which was fought between the Entente Powers (France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Russia, the United Kingdom, and later Italy, Greece, Romania, and the United States) and the Central Powers (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire). The War left more than 16\\u00a0million civilians and military dead.  Over 60\\u00a0million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918.\\n\\nRussia was plunged into the Russian Revolution, which threw down the Tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist Soviet Union.  Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn. The Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I in 1919, was harsh towards Germany, upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions. \\n\\nExcess deaths in Russia over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18 million.  In 1932\\u20131933, under Stalin's leadership, confiscations of grain by the Soviet authorities contributed to the second Soviet famine which caused millions of deaths;  surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour. Stalin was also responsible for the Great Purge of 1937\\u201338 in which the NKVD executed 681,692 people;  millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the Soviet Union. \\n\\nEconomic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought about the worldwide Great Depression. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, fascist movements developed throughout Europe placing Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany, Francisco Franco of Spain and Benito Mussolini of Italy in power.  \\n\\nIn 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the Saarland and Rhineland in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, Austria became a part of Germany following the Anschluss. Later that year, following the Munich Agreement signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, which was a part of Czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, controlled by Germany, and the Slovak Republic. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of appeasement.\\n\\nWith tensions mounting between Germany and Poland over the future of Danzig, the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the Molotov\\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the European Theatre of World War II.   The Soviet invasion of Poland started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the Baltic countries and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at Narvik and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The Phoney War continued.\\n\\nIn May 1940, Germany attacked France through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a bombing offensive on Britain, but failed to convince the Britons to give up.  In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the Operation Barbarossa.  On 7 December 1941 Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the British Empire and other allied forces.  \\n\\nAfter the staggering Battle of Stalingrad in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The Battle of Kursk, which involved the largest tank battle in history, was the last major German offensive on the Eastern Front. In 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the D-Day landings, opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally fell in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. The war was the largest and most destructive in human history, with 60\\u00a0million dead across the world.  More than 40\\u00a0million people in Europe had died as a result of World War II,  including between 11 and 17\\u00a0million people who perished during the Holocaust.  The Soviet Union lost around 27\\u00a0million people (mostly civilians) during the war, about half of all World War II casualties.  By the end of World War II, Europe had more than 40\\u00a0million refugees.  Several post-war expulsions in Central and Eastern Europe displaced a total of about 20\\u00a0million people. \\n\\nWorld War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the Yalta Conference and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by Winston Churchill an \\\"Iron Curtain\\\". The United States and Western Europe\\nestablished the NATO alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the Warsaw Pact. \\n\\nThe two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on nuclear proliferation. At the same time decolonisation, which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.\\nIn the 1980s the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Solidarity movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.\\n\\nEuropean integration also grew after World War II. The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the European Economic Community between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.  In 1967 the EEC, European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom formed the European Community, which in 1993 became the European Union. The EU established a parliament, court and central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency.  In 2004 and 2007, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, expanding the EU to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power. \\n\\nGeography\\n\\nEurope makes up the western fifth of the Eurasian landmass. It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.  Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south. \\nLand relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the Great European Plain, and at its heart lies the North German Plain. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.\\n\\nThis description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.\\n\\nClimate\\n\\nEurope lies mainly in the temperate climate zones, being subjected to prevailing westerlies. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.  The Gulf Stream is nicknamed \\\"Europe's central heating\\\", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\\n\\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is 16\\u00a0\\u00b0C (60.8\\u00a0\\u00b0F), while it is only 12\\u00a0\\u00b0C (53.6\\u00a0\\u00b0F) in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around 8\\u00a0\\u00b0C (15\\u00a0\\u00b0F) higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost 22\\u00a0\\u00b0C (40\\u00a0\\u00b0F) higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk. Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a tempertate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is 9.05 degrees Celsius (48.3 degrees Fahrenheit). However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of -6.5 degrees Celsius (20.3 degrees Fahrenheit), giving it a nearly subarctic climate.\\n\\nGeology\\n\\nThe geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the Baltic Shield (Fennoscandia) and the Sarmatian craton, both around 2.25\\u00a0billion years ago, followed by the Volgo\\u2013Uralia shield, the three together leading to the East European craton (\\u2248 Baltica) which became a part of the supercontinent Columbia. Around 1.1\\u00a0billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the Laurentia block) became joined to Rodinia, later resplitting around 550\\u00a0million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440\\u00a0million years ago Euramerica was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with Gondwana then leading to the formation of Pangea. Around 190\\u00a0million years ago, Gondwana and Laurasia split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via Greenland, leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50\\u00a0million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late Tertiary period about five million years ago. \\n\\nThe geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary.  Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and Alps/Carpathians. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea complex and Barents Sea.\\n\\nThe northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica, and so may be regarded geologically as the \\\"main continent\\\", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent Avalonia.\\n\\nFlora\\n\\nHaving lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of Fennoscandia and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various national parks.\\n\\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed forest. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these (Alps, Pyrenees) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north (Scandinavian Mountains, Dinarides, Carpathians, Apennines) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.\\n\\nProbably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.  It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Though over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation, Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the broadlef and mixed forests, taiga of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed rainforests of the Caucasus and the Cork oak forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2\\u20133% or less, in European Russia 5\\u201310%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is Iceland (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%). \\n\\nIn temperate Europe, mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are beech and oak. In the north, the taiga is a mixed spruce\\u2013pine\\u2013birch forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to tundra as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many olive trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; Mediterranean Cypress is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian grassland (the steppe) extends eastwards from Ukraine and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.\\n\\nFauna\\n\\nGlaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the Neolithic period. Today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).\\n\\nEuropean wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).\\n\\nImportant European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others.  A number of insects, such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly, add to the biodiversity. \\n\\nThe extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the Mediterranean. \\n\\nSea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly phytoplankton. Important animals that live in European seas are zooplankton, molluscs, echinoderms, different crustaceans, squids and octopuses, fish, dolphins, and whales.\\n\\nBiodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's Bern Convention, which has also been signed by the European Community as well as non-European states.\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nThe list below includes all entities falling even partially under any of the various common definitions of Europe, geographic or political. The data displayed are per sources in cross-referenced articles.\\n\\nWithin the above-mentioned states are several de facto independent countries with limited to no international recognition. None of them are members of the UN:\\n\\nSeveral dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes \\u00c5land (a region of Finland), two constituent countries of the Kingdom Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three Crown dependencies, and two British Overseas Territories. Not included are the three countries of the United Kingdom with devolved powers and the two Autonomous Regions of Portugal, which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as Svalbard, Heligoland and the Canary Islands, are also not included for this reason.\\n\\nIntegration\\n\\nEuropean integration is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of states wholly or partially in Europe. While the Council of Europe\\u2014which includes almost all European states\\u2014has promoted pan-Europe cooperation, the European Union has been the focus of economic integration on the continent. More recently, the Eurasian Economic Union has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.\\n\\n28 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free Schengen Area and 19 of the monetary union Eurozone. Among the smaller European organizations are the Nordic Council, the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly and the Visegr\\u00e1d Group.\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nAs a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7\\u00a0trillion compared to North America's $27.1\\u00a0trillion in 2008.  In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.  As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the West; some of the Central and Eastern European economies are still emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\\n\\nThe European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the largest single economic area in the world. 18 EU countries share the euro as a common currency.\\nFive European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest national economies in GDP (PPP). This includes (ranks according to the CIA): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10). \\n\\nThere is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is Moldova with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).  Monaco is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n;Industrial growth (1760\\u20131945)\\n\\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.  From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.  The Industrial Revolution started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,  and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.\\n\\n;Cold War (1945\\u20131991)\\n\\nAfter World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,  and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.  Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.  France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of Franco, also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the Spanish miracle.  The majority of Central and Eastern European states came under the control of the Soviet Union and thus were members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON). \\n\\nThe states which retained a free-market system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the Marshall Plan.\\n  The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the Cold War. Until 1990, the European Community was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.\\n\\n;Reunification (1991\\u20132016)\\n\\nWith the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and Slovenia adopted them reasonably quickly, while Ukraine and Russia are still in the process of doing so.\\n\\nAfter East and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.\\nBy the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the Eurozone replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden.\\nThe European Union is now the largest economy in the world. \\n\\nFigures released by Eurostat in 2009 confirmed that the Eurozone had gone into recession in 2008.  It impacted much of the region.  In 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis  developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal.  As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone.  The EU-27 unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012.  For those aged 15\\u201324 it was 22.4%. \\n\\nDemographics\\n\\nSince the Renaissance, Europe has had a major influence in culture, economics and social movements in the world. The most significant inventions had their origins in the Western world, primarily Europe and the United States.   Approximately 70 million Europeans died through war, violence and famine between 1914 and 1945.  Some current and past issues in European demographics have included religious emigration, race relations, economic immigration, a declining birth rate and an ageing population.\\n\\nIn some countries, such as Ireland and Poland, access to abortion is limited. It remains illegal on the island of Malta. Furthermore, three European countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland) and the Autonomous Community of Andalusia (Spain)   have allowed a limited form of voluntary euthanasia for some terminally ill people.\\n\\nIn 2005, the population of Europe was estimated to be 731\\u00a0million according to the United Nations, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the world's population.  The population of Europe has grown in the past century, but in other areas of the world (in particular Africa and Asia) the population has grown far more quickly.  Among the continents, Europe has a relatively high population density, second only to Asia. The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is Monaco. Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \\\"peoples of Europe\\\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. \\nAccording to UN population projection, Europe's population may fall to about 7% of world population by 2050, or 653\\u00a0million people (medium variant, 556 to 777\\u00a0million in low and high variants, respectively). Within this context, significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates. The average number of children per female of child bearing age is 1.52. According to some sources,  this rate is higher among Muslims in Europe. The UN predicts a steady population decline in Central and Eastern Europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates. \\n\\nEurope is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at 70.6 million people, the IOM's report said.  In 2005, the EU had an overall net gain from immigration of 1.8\\u00a0million people. This accounted for almost 85% of Europe's total population growth.  The European Union plans to open the job centres for legal migrant workers from Africa.   In 2008, 696,000 persons were given citizenship of an EU27 member state, a decrease from 707,000 the previous year. \\n\\nEmigration from Europe began with Spanish and Portuguese settlers in the 16th century,   and French and English settlers in the 17th century. But numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the 19th century, when millions of poor families left Europe. \\n\\nToday, large populations of European descent are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Brazil, while most of the other Latin American countries also have a considerable population of European origins). Australia and New Zealand have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of Cape Verde and probably S\\u00e3o Tom\\u00e9 and Pr\\u00edncipe, depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the White South Africans. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in Northern Asia (specifically Russians), some parts of Northern Kazakhstan and Israel. \\n\\nLanguages\\n\\nEuropean languages mostly fall within three Indo-European language groups: the Romance languages, derived from the Latin of the Roman Empire; the Germanic languages, whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the Slavic languages.\\n\\nSlavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in Romania and Moldova, in Central or Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of Central Europe.\\n\\nMany other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European languages include the Baltic group (that is, Latvian and Lithuanian), the Celtic group (that is, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton), Greek, Armenian, and Albanian. In addition, a distinct group of Uralic languages (Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian) is spoken mainly in Estonia, Finland, and Hungary, while Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian, and Svan), are spoken primarily in Georgia, and two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed Northeast Caucasian, most notably including Chechen, Avar and Lezgin and Northwest Caucasian, notably including Adyghe). Maltese is the only Semitic language that is official within the EU, while Basque is the only European language isolate. Turkic languages include Azerbaijani and Turkish, in addition to the languages of minority nations in Russia.\\n\\nMultilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the Council of Europe's European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nHistorically, religion in Europe has been a major influence on European art, culture, philosophy and law. The largest religion in Europe is Christianity, with 76.2% of Europeans considering themselves Christians,  including Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and various Protestant denominations (especially historically state-supported European ones such as Lutheranism, Anglicanism and the Reformed faith). The notion of \\\"Europe\\\" and the \\\"Western World\\\" has been intimately connected with the concept of \\\"Christianity and Christendom\\\" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity. \\n\\nChristianity, including the Roman Catholic Church,   has played  a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization since at least the 4th century.     and for at least a millennium and a half, Europe has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture, even though the religion was inherited from the Middle East. Christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science.  \\n\\nThe second most popular religion is Islam (6%)  concentrated mainly in the Balkans and eastern Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, Kosovo, Kazakhstan, North Cyprus, Turkey, Azerbaijan, North Caucasus, and the Volga-Ural region). Other religions, including Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are minority religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia's Republic of Kalmykia). The 20th century saw the revival of Neopaganism through movements such as Wicca and Druidry.\\n\\nEurope has become a relatively secular continent, with an increasing number and proportion of irreligious, atheist and agnostic people which make up about 18.2% of Europeans population,  actually the largest secular in the Western world. There are a particularly high number of self-described non-religious people in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Sweden, former East Germany, and France. \\n\\nCulture\\n\\nThe culture of Europe can be described as a series of overlapping cultures; cultural mixes exist across the continent. Scholar Andreas Kaplan describes Europe as \\\"embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances\\\".  There are cultural innovations and movements, sometimes at odds with each other. Thus, the question of \\\"common culture\\\" or \\\"common values\\\" is complex.\\n\\nAccording to historian Hilaire Belloc, for several centuries the peoples of Europe based their self-identification on the remaining traces of the Roman culture and on the concept of Christendom, because many European-wide military alliances were of religious nature: the Crusades (1095\\u20131291), the Reconquista (711\\u20131492), the Battle of Lepanto (1571).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

It featured the rock anthem \\\"Here I Go Again '87\\\" as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, \\\"it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake\\\". Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. M\\u00f6tley Cr\\u00fce with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling d\\u00e9but of all time, Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a \\\"grittier\\\" and \\\"rawer\\\" sound than most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one \\\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\\". Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In the last years of the decade, the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith, and M\\u00f6tley Cr\\u00fce's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous d\\u00e9but (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era.\",\n          \"After a three-year hiatus, a fifth Digimon series began airing on April 2, 2006. Like Frontier, Savers has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (\\\"Digital Accident Tactics Squad\\\"), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist named Akihiro Kurata, determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by Studiopolis and it premiered on the Jetix block on Toon Disney on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in Data Squad requires the human partner's DNA (\\\"Digital Natural Ability\\\" in the English version and \\\"Digisoul\\\" in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. 'Digimon Savers' also introduces a new form of digivolving called Burst Mode which is essentially the level above Mega (previously the strongest form a digimon could take). Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21. Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization (Marcus Damon as opposed to the Japanese Daimon Masaru), cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub. Also despite the heavy censorship and the English dub aimed at young children, some of the Digimon's attacks named after real weapons such as RizeGreymon's Trident Revolver are not edited and used in the English dub. Well Go USA released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American English dub was televised on Jetix in the U.S. and on the Family Channel in Canada.\",\n          \"The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues (or Bucolics) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39\\u201338 BC, although this is controversial. The Eclogues (from the Greek for \\\"selections\\\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry (\\\"pastoral poetry\\\") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. After his victory in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, fought against the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar, Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, supposedly including, according to the tradition, an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil. The loss of his family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as Virgil's motives in the composition of the Eclogues. This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues. In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom, but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident. While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl. 1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl. 2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl. 5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought. The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective. Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside. 2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl. 2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl. 3). Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \\\"Messianic Eclogue\\\" uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate). 5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus. Virgil is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus, and later writers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n
